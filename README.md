# Portfolio devlog

## Introduction

This project started with a clear objective: to minimize my reliance on JavaScript. I had the perfect project for it—my portfolio. Over the years, I've started countless portfolio projects using the latest frameworks, but I never finished them. The reasons varied from feature creep to losing interest in the framework.

HTMX has been rising in popularity lately, promising _no JavaScript_ and none of the complexity often associated with frontend frameworks. This was perfect, and I planned to leverage HTMX from the start. However, as soon as I started mocking up designs, curiosity struck: how far could I go using just HTML and CSS? Could I create a functional, aesthetically pleasing, and interactive web application with just HTML and CSS alone?

This challenge set the stage for a fascinating journey, pushing the boundaries of what HTML and CSS can achieve before integrating HTMX. It was also a great opportunity to learn about the performance of HTML and CSS, as JavaScript would not be the largest overhead.

In this devlog, I’ll share my experiences and insights as I navigated through HTML and CSS, eventually integrating HTMX to enhance my web application. My goal: to create a modern-looking, fully featured, performant portfolio using as little JavaScript as possible. *Rules: CSS and HTML hacks are only allowed as long as they don't significantly hurt accessibility or performance.*
